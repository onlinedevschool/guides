# Extracted from Rails

This is great piece of software even if the code is pretty messy by my own OCD standards. I have
attempted to clean it up a little and isolate it from that monster that birthed it. Feel free to
use it to create your own guides and tutorials.

Adopt and extend.

## Why did you extract this?

I am building a catalog of Technology Guides for the discerning Ruby/Rails developers out there
and this fits the bill nicely. You can learn more at (RubyMentor)[https://rubymentor.io]
